👋 Hi, there. My name is Hoedong Kim. 

🎓 Soon to be grad with a M.S. in Data Science at Columbia University. (Dec 2026)

🌇 Based in New York City, with a passion for developing and applying mathematical and statistical models to hands-on strategies that will grow business.

📚 I previously spent nearly six years at Samsung Electronics as a Signal Integrity and Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineer, where I worked with measurement data to analyze signal and noise patterns. Through this experience, I developed a strong foundation in working with complex engineering data and gained a deep appreciation for data-driven decision-making. I also served as a squad leader for approximately 20 months during my military service, which strengthened my leadership and communication skills.

💻 In the future, I hope to work as a data scientist solving meaningful, real-world problems. My goal is to build data-driven solutions that create positive impact beyond metrics and dashboards.

⚽️ In my free time, I love playing soccer, and I’ve been part of soccer clubs throughout school, playing every week.

💪 Expertise in applying statistical and machine learning methods to real-world problems
<br>&emsp;&ensp;Ability to design effective data visualizations for clear communication of insights
<br>&emsp;&ensp;Strong background in data-driven problem solving within engineering domains
<br>&emsp;&ensp;Demonstrated collaboration and communication skills through team-based work
<br>&emsp;&ensp;Self-motivated learner with the ability to adapt quickly in dynamic environments
